![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

The Pair Programming. It wasn't just me sitting back and watching Isaiah but it was me seeing where we needed to go to next to resolve an issue and asking a question every step of the way when I didn't understand something. 

2. What went well this week?

Learning how to develop with someone, that was probably the hardest part was planning but then implementing our plan too. I thought we had done a great job so far. 

3. What would you do differently?

Probably have stand ups more often. We needed to take breaks more often as well and stop looking at the screen every now and then. But going into this was good to know how you work with someone else when under pressure and how you can learn from them too.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

We didn't finish exactly on time so it's good to know that your estimates will sometimes be optimistic when working on stuff.
