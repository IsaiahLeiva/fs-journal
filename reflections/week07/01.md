## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming is when 2 programmers share a single workstation. One is the driver and the other is the navigator. The driver will be doing the actual programming and the other will focus on the overall direction of the project.

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

There are many: Increased code quality, better diffusion of knowledge among the team, better transfer of skills, and a large reduction in coordination efforts. 

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

One drawback is "double cost" meaning that one programmer is perceived as not doing anything while the other simply programs. This is not always the case since both programmers are often doing equal work.

I'm looking forward to pair programming with Isaiah this week. But I'm also looking forward to "programming out loud" and seeing how this will benefit me.
