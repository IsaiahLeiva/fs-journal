## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

A user experience is every interaction your business has with people on your website, mobile site, apps, and online properties or services. 

What should be considered when thinking about UX is the focus on the user no matter where they are. 

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

If your website has good UX design it will make people feel good and stick around or come back to your website. It makes people stick around and become customers to your business and start recommending it to other people as well.

3. Why is the User Experience important?

As stated above the UX can be important to your business to increase your customer base. But also it establishes a good reputation to your website. 

It helps customers to be given control by having them do what they want to do rather than be rushed into buying something on your site.
