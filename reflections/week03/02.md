## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

From the reading it seems as though it saves resources quite a bit. If we are encapsulating the different web pages we work with we save resources rather than adding all of our code to one or two webpages and therefore slowing down performance.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

They wouldn't allow privacy for a property in JS.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

By using encapsulation methods. This will ensure that the users who do have access to data streams will be unable to access the private methods and data.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

It is important to know the difference between the different pages in the MCV environment and how to use them. I understand that this is going to help us in the long run when we get a job after cw. We will definitely need to use this more often and I believe that we will going forward when we perform the exercises.
