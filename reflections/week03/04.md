2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

-Provide methods to register and remove observer
-Maintains a list of its observers
-And notify them automatically when any state changes

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

The proxystate contains the data (or the ingredients of the kitchen) and applies them to the webpage, they can be accessed by multiple different points and help keep the webpage in sync.
