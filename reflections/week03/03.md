## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

Get and Set

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

You must set up a trap to ensure that the value does not return undefined. 

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

The proxy object will help keep some of our code private. It will enable us to disable the users with internal access from manipulating our code by passing functions through it.
