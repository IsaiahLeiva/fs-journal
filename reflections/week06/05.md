# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

What I am sort of struggling with still is terminology related to Vue still. I understand for the most part how Vue works but knowing the patterns on how/why it works is something I am understanding more so. I would like to go over how the patterns work for Front-end for Vue and why the pages and components work the way they do. 

I've come a long way and I need to be positive. So far it has helped me. I understand that the others in class were feeling very set back once we started on this checkpoint but I know that we can get there. As they say in class "positive vibes only".
