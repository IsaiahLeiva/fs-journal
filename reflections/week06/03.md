Lifecycle hooks allow you to know when your component is created, added to the DOM, updated or destroyed.

I don't believe I have yet but I think it's important to use them. This is for documentation purposes but I realize that eventually it will be important to use them in business practices.

Mounting hooks allow you to access your component immediately before and after the first render.
