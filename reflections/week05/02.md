## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

One-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

The benefits are that it's more efficient. Instead of having to add the information to each and every document you can use keys to tag the information to each entry in the relational database model. 

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

One way embedding could provide a solution to this. For example, when you have an array of books and each book has multiple categories in it.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Learning backend has been exciting so far but it's tough to keep track of everything that's being thrown at me. It's good to go to the instructors and repeat everything I've absorbed after the lectures to make sure that I understand what I've been taught.
