## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

It is a time management technique that is meant to guide you to designating solving a task to a specific amount of time.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

Realizing that "my inbox is not my action list", Find my "golden hour" during the day when I'm going to be most productive. 

Lastly, prioritize. The most important thing that I need to do is figure out which tasks are the most important but then also to not overplan 

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

Probably the first two weeks with learning how to code. There is so much thrown at us and learning how to prioritize which things are the most important to learn at the moment would have benefitted me greatly.
