## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending/Resolved/Rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Promises are a way to write async code that appears as that it's executing in a top-down way and handles more errors. 

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

the 'then()' method is only for resolved promises and the 'catch()' promise is for any promise that isn't resolved.
