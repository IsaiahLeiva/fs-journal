# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I understand on a deeper level how the model view controller works now and how the JS files interact with each other. I even invented an abbreviation for myself. MCMSP (Main, Controller, Model, Service and ProxyState) to help myself remember the associations. 

In terms of what I'm struggling with, there's still a lot of stuff to go over. I can't really say that I have the confidence to keep up with what we're learning. I'm going to give it my all on this checkpoint and see what happens since the cirriculum is so brutal for those who have zero coding experience. It's especially difficult knowing that on some days the TAs are only available about half the time. We'll see how this goes.
