## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

It allows you to plan out what you want to have on the webpage before you start to code. You can code on the fly but without direction it might take longer to finish your webpage. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

First google it to research what the problem actually is and then try to find a different work-around. If you are then still stuck then ask for help from a TA.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

There are many takeaways from that article, there are things that are beginning to crop up for me that I didn't realize would be necessary for me to do. I've realized that it is rather pointless for me to go back over my code and delete it. I've also noticed that I tend to code too much when I'm going through an exercise. I need to stop overthinking when I code and go through it patiently.
