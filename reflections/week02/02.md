## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

The three ways are to write the function as a function declaration, meaning the function keyword will be followed by the name of the function. Then there is the function expression which defines a named or anonymous function, and lastly there is the arrow function, which is in general a shorter syntax for writing expressions since it has no function declaration and just has the parameters. 

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

A parameter is what goes into the parentheses for the function and are used when determining a function. An argument are the values that the function receives from each parameter. 

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

A higher order function is a function that accepts another function as a parameter. For example if you write out a function like this: function.person.hair or function.person.age then that function is accepting a few others to specify a value.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

It is important to know the JS fundamentals but I'm slowing learning that you need to know the rules before you break them. There is the standard way of JS but you can adapt it to make it more comfortable to the way that you code. It's good to keep things as standard as possible but JS is much more flexible than everything else I've learned.
