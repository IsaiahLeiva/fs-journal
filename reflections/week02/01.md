## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope dictates where variables are available for use. 


2. What is Hoisting ?

Is where variables and and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before execution.


3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

It depends on how and when you will be using the variables that will be attached to the code. "Var" is globally scoped meaning you can use it anywhere and is easily manipulated, "Let" is block scoped meaning that as long as it is contained within a function it will perform as expected but cannot work outside of a function. "Const" is a variable that is set in stone once it is set, because it cannot be updated or re-declared.
