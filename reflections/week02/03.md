## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

You should typically write javascript to the console. This is where you can see which errors you'll be getting on the webpage. Elements are mainly for HTML and CSS and can be used in the dev tools in order to actively see on your web page where you can make improvements.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Elements tab in the dev tool collection can help with this. This is where you can manipulate the CSS and HTML itself to see in real time how it will look on the webpage. You can adjust color and sizing actively on the webpage and then adjust your code so you don't have to go back and forth from VSCode to the webpage itself.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Start off by writing the javascript initially to your vscode and then once you have the initial code then troubleshoot by opening the dev tools and seeing which errors are showing up in the console. This helps you target which lines are throwing errors and setting up break points.
