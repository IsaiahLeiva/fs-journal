## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A pseudo-class is used to define a specific property of an element. At this point it's very early to predict which one I will use the most but I think 'link' will be the most common. 

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

>specificity allows us to select a css property that could be being targeted by multiple rules. I could use it to target a css property that might be inconvenient to move in my code or by raising its value to be targeting and applied by css easily. 

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

If you use it too much you could run into the potential of confusing your script. If !important is used too often then VScode will be unable to select which element or property is the most important and will be unable to run properly.
