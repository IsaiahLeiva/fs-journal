## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

I think a couple of my favorite that I've read so far are not making your button or logos too big. I didn't realize that if you try to increase their size that they'll look off, since they're not designed to be that big. 

Also not adding a shadow to every button that's on the page. In the side-by-side comparison on the about page it looks much nicer when you don't overdo the button shadow and keep it minimalist. 

Basically less is more when it comes to design. 

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

Bootstrap as a whole will be a helpful resource when designing a webpage. But if we need to talk about specifics then adding the text-center or text-align to our bootstrap in the HTML code.

Adding box shadow to most of our elements and design will be helpful in improving design on our websites.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Good design influences people subtly but it makes sense to do so. People can tell subconsciously through the website's design how professional it is and if it's poorly designed they won't hire you or trust your design judgement. 

You can convey your skills and professionalism by showing a nice and clean design. So obviously it is very important to do it the right way.
