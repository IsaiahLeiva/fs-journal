## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

>We use Git in order to keep track of the work we do with the code that we enter. Git keeps tracks the code that is entered and distributes the information across a distributed network, so others are able to see it as well. 

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

>Having multiple branches allows you to test multiple parallel branches of the same development and allows a developer to test the code out without affecting the main branch of a project. 

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

>Git is a way to track changes in code and to see git history of the code. While GitHub is an online repository of code that showcases the code.
