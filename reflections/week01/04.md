## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

Wire-framing enables a developer to be able to design the webpage before actually writing the code. It allows the developer to see where the information will need to be placed beforehand and acts as a blueprint for the webpage.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There are low-fidelity, mid-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes. Low-fi can be useful if you are sketching out a fresh idea and want to sketch out very rough ideas, mid-fi can be useful when you are ready to begin with placing the headers, footers and locate where links to different pages will end up. High-fi will be useful because it allows you to play with the color scheme and look as close as possible to your finished webpage as possible. 

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Yes, I think it helps developers plan ahead and saves TEE when it comes to designing a webpage. It will save time for a developer when knowing exactly where to place the rows and columns will be necessary when starting the code from scratch.

Continuing to struggle with bootstrap but understanding how it's applied and why it's applied. I see now how we can start with the original methods of coding i.e. HTML or CSS but then use wireframing and bootstrap to help expedite what we want to do and make life easier.
