# MVC

Main pages:

index.html
'var'Controller page
'var' Service page
Model page which will just stand for the variable you're working with
'AppState' which is the proxy state page


import other pages by simply typing out the other classes

-Interpolation: for the color value you would enter it in place of the value itself
