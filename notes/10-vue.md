# MVC

For Vue frameworks start with Vue-server when creating a project. 

Is a framework that gets turned back into js when it is run from the source. 

The only thing different in the server from now on in Vue will be that instead of ProxyState you can type AppState. 

Listeners will be created for us automatically.

Controllers will be done away with and we will have components instead now.

You can create small localized components and inject them in together with Vue.
