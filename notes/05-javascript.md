primitive values are:
number: (1,2,3)
string: (Hello)
boolean: (true, false)

non-primitive values are:
let object = {thing: "it's a thing"}
let array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
function example(){
    console.log('Hello, world!')
}

//number math and operators:
number++ means that it will add 1 to the number
number-- means that it will subtract 1 from the number
number += 5 //Note: will add 5 to the number (number = number + 5)
let sum = 2 + number will add 2 to the number

* = multiply
/ = divide
% = divides the number and then leaves the remainder (2%5= 1)

number == 5 //returns true or false
number === 5 //Forces a value  

> = greater than
< = less than
>= equal to or greater than
<= equal to or less than

//String Operators
string = '' "" ``
string += ' world' //Means string = string + ' world'
string = `Hello ${string2}` //this is interpolation


//bool operators
bool == true //are these equal?
bool != true //are these not equal?

&& = means "and" in a syntax
|| = means "or" in a syntax
